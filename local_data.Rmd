The dataset for GBM that I have downloaded, using the RTCGA package, contains a low number of samples. Ashar mentioned that there is also local GBM data (which is older, so I should be careful), and I could compare the patients in both datasets (look at the overlap).
```{r}
load("/home/abidata/datasets/patients/GBM_TCGA/clinical.rda")
local_data_clin <- clinical
new_data_clin <- GBM.clinical
local_data_clin$patient <- toupper(local_data_clin$patient)
new_data_clin$patient.bcr_patient_barcode <- toupper(new_data_clin$patient.bcr_patient_barcode)
# View(clinical) 
inter <- local_data_clin$patient[local_data_clin$patient %in% new_data_clin$patient.bcr_patient_barcode]
```
```{r}
length(inter)
nrow(local_data_clin)
nrow(new_data_clin)
```

Maybe a Venn diagram is easier for visualization:
```{r}
# install.packages("VennDiagram", lib = "../R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.3")
# library("VennDiagram", lib.loc = "../R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.3")
clin_venn <- venn.diagram(list(local = local_data_clin$patient, new = new_data_clin$patient.bcr_patient_barcode), filename = NULL)
grid.newpage(recording = FALSE)
grid.draw(clin_venn, recording = FALSE)
```
The overlap is very large, but this is only clinical data. The problem with low number of samples was predominantly a problem in miRNASeq and mRNA data:

```{r}
load("/home/abidata/datasets/patients/GBM_TCGA/miRNAExpression.rda")
load("/home/abidata/datasets/patients/GBM_TCGA/mRNAExpression.rda")
```

```{r}
mRNA_new <- toupper(GBM_mRNA$patient_id)
mRNA_old <- toupper(colnames(mRNA))
mRNA_venn <- venn.diagram(list(local = mRNA_old, new = mRNA_new), filename = NULL)
grid.newpage(recording = FALSE)
grid.draw(mRNA_venn, recording = FALSE)
```

Hmm, the intersection is zero. Check if the barcode's are in the same format:
```{r}
mRNA_new[1:4]
mRNA_old[1:4]
```

It's not in the same format. Read more about how these barcodes are constructed.

It seems like the 'CS' patients are from a Lower Grade Glioma study (GBMLGG), which is not the same as GMB (I think...). Check this.
https://cancergenome.nih.gov/cancersselected/lowergradeglioma: there are indications that LGG is a precursor to the more debilitating GBM.

For miRNA:
```{r}
miRNA_new <- toupper(GBM_miRNASeq$patient_id)
miRNA_old <- toupper(colnames(miRNA))
miRNA_venn <- venn.diagram(list(local = miRNA_old, new = miRNA_new), filename = NULL)
grid.newpage(recording = FALSE)
grid.draw(miRNA_venn, recording = FALSE)
```
```{r}
miRNA_new[1:4]
miRNA_old[1:4]
```
